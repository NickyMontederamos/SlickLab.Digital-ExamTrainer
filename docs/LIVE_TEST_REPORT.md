# Live Test Report — Booking → Anti-Cheat → Integrity Review

**Date:** 2026-08-26
**Commit tested:** `4809d6c` (feat: real booking flow, network-connectivity logging in integrity review)
**Scope:** Full end-to-end walkthrough of everything built in `docs/PITCH_ROADMAP.md`
Milestones 1, 2, and the pulled-forward parts of Milestone 4 — booking, the exam-taking
UI, the 3-strike anti-cheat core, and the faculty integrity review flow, including both
possible decisions (Reinstate and Confirm Violation).

## How this was tested

Two passes, both against the real dev server (`npm run dev`, not mocked data):

1. **A recorded pass** — a small headless-Playwright script drove the app end-to-end
   and saved a real screenshot at every step to `docs/screenshots/`. This is what the
   numbered screenshots below come from. (A **headed** — visible-window — browser was
   attempted first so the run could be watched directly; it failed with `spawn UNKNOWN`
   in this environment, consistent with no desktop/window-station access for spawning
   GUI processes from this session. Switched to headless, which works fine for
   screenshot capture — it just doesn't produce an on-screen window.)
2. **A live pass in the Browser pane**, driven interactively and watched in real time,
   covering the same flow plus the one branch the recorded pass didn't take: an
   integrity violation resolved as **Reinstate** instead of **Confirm Violation**,
   showing the student resuming and finishing normally. Screenshots from this pass are
   inline below (not saved as files, since the Browser pane tool doesn't support saving
   to disk — only the headless script's screenshots are permanent files).

Every screenshot in this report is a real, unedited capture of the running app — no
mockups, no hand-drawn diagrams.

## Part 1 — Faculty authors and publishes an exam with a booking window

### 1. Login

![Login page](screenshots/01-login-page.png)

Institution branding (College of Maasin — College of Law seal + crest), the
`AppHeader`-free login screen, and the SlickLab.Digital corner credit bottom-right.

### 2. Faculty dashboard

![Faculty dashboard](screenshots/02-faculty-dashboard.png)

### 3. Adding a question to the course's bank

![Question added to bank](screenshots/03-question-added-to-bank.png)

### 4. Creating an exam with an availability window

![Create exam form with booking window](screenshots/04-create-exam-form-with-window.png)

This is the new part: `Available from` / `Available until` fields on the exam-creation
form, writing to `ExamVersion.availableFrom`/`availableUntil` — fields that existed in
the schema from day one but were never exposed in any UI until this pass.

### 5–6. Draft exam, question attached

![Exam created as draft](screenshots/05-exam-created-draft.png)
![Question attached to the exam](screenshots/06-question-attached-to-exam.png)

### 7. Published

![Exam published](screenshots/07-exam-published.png)

---

## Part 2 — Student books the exam (Book → Confirm → Receipt)

### 8. Student dashboard

![Student dashboard](screenshots/08-student-dashboard.png)

### 9. Booking screen — shows the available window

![Book exam, available window shown](screenshots/09-book-exam-available-window.png)

The window set in Part 1 renders here exactly as configured: *"Aug 25, 2026, 7:23 PM –
Aug 26, 2026, 3:23 AM"* in the recorded run. No booking infrastructure was invented —
this reads directly from the exam version already fetched for the page.

### 10. Booking confirmed — the receipt

![Booking confirmed receipt](screenshots/10-booking-confirmed-receipt.png)

A confirmation code (the attempt's id), the exam title, and the window — the concrete
"Receive receipt" step from the requested flow. At this point the attempt exists in the
database with status `NOT_STARTED` and **no timer running** — `startedAt` is still null.

### 11. Exam Rules — a separate step from booking

![Exam Rules screen](screenshots/11-exam-rules-screen.png)

Per the real precedent this flow was modeled on (Book → *later* → Read Rules → device
checks → exam), Rules is its own screen after the receipt, not bundled into booking.

---

## Part 3 — The mocked entry-gate sequence

Four scripted steps, each a couple of seconds, between agreeing to the rules and the
exam actually starting. All are simulated — no real camera access, no real proctor —
by deliberate choice (see `docs/PITCH_ROADMAP.md`'s fidelity decision): a missing or
blocked webcam on a demo device must never be able to derail a live pitch.

### 12. Device check (the one real check — soft fullscreen request)

![Gate: device check](screenshots/12-gate-device-check.png)

### 13. Identity verification (fully mocked)

![Gate: identity verification](screenshots/13-gate-identity-verification.png)

### 14. Room scan (fully mocked)

![Gate: room scan](screenshots/14-gate-room-scan.png)

### 15. Waiting for proctor (fully mocked)

![Gate: waiting for proctor](screenshots/15-gate-waiting-for-proctor.png)

**Verified in both passes:** the exam's countdown timer does not start during this
sequence. `beginBookedAttempt()` — which sets `startedAt` — is only called after step
15 completes, not when "Start Exam" is first clicked. The receipt above and the
exam-taking screen below have different, independently-verified timestamps; the ~8
seconds of gate sequence between them cost the student nothing.

---

## Part 4 — Taking the exam

### 16. One question at a time, with a palette

![Exam taking, question 1](screenshots/16-exam-taking-question-1.png)

The countdown reads **9:59 remaining** for a 10-minute exam — confirming the timer
started only once the gate finished, per the note above. The numbered palette (`1`)
shows one question; `allowBacktracking`/pagination controls (`← Previous`, `Next →`)
sit below the question, and Calculator/Notepad are now top-left (moved from
bottom-left specifically so they stop colliding with Next.js's own dev-mode indicator
badge, which also lives bottom-left in `next dev`).

### 17. Flagging a question before answering it

![Question flagged](screenshots/17-question-flagged.png)

### 18–19. Notepad and Calculator

![Notepad open](screenshots/18-notepad-open.png)
![Calculator open](screenshots/19-calculator-open.png)

Both are client-only scratch tools — nothing here is graded or persisted, and neither
requires a server round-trip to open.

### 20. The flag survives a save

![Flag persisted after Save Progress](screenshots/20-flag-persisted-after-save.png)

A **"Flagged"** badge appears next to Q1 after clicking Save Progress — proof the flag
round-tripped through the server (`saveAnswers` → `ExamAnswer.isFlagged`) rather than
just being local UI state.

---

## Part 5 — The 3-strike anti-cheat core, with network events as context (not strikes)

This is the part of the test built specifically to answer two things asked directly:
*"does Alt+Tab actually get caught"* and *"does a dropped connection unfairly cost a
student a strike."*

### 21. Warning 1 of 3 (a real `WINDOW_BLUR` event)

![Warning 1 of 3](screenshots/21-warning-1-of-3.png)

### 22. A network drop is logged but does **not** move the counter

![Network offline logged, warning count unchanged](screenshots/22-network-offline-logged-no-warning-change.png)

This screenshot is the same "Warning 1 of 3" state as #21, captured again immediately
after dispatching a `NETWORK_OFFLINE` event — the banner is provably unchanged. Under
the hood, `recordAttemptEvent()` always recomputes the warning count from
`STRIKE_EVENT_TYPES` only (`WINDOW_BLUR`, `VISIBILITY_HIDDEN`, `FULLSCREEN_EXIT`);
`NETWORK_OFFLINE`/`NETWORK_ONLINE` are written to the same event log for later context
but are structurally excluded from that count.

### 23. Warning 2 of 3 (a second real strike, after the network event and a recovery)

![Warning 2 of 3](screenshots/23-warning-2-of-3.png)

The sequence up to this point was: strike → offline → strike → online — proving
network events can be interleaved with real strikes without ever inflating the count.

### 24. Auto-pause on the 3rd strike

![Attempt auto-paused](screenshots/24-attempt-auto-paused.png)

The exam-taking UI disappears entirely and is replaced by a plain "paused, pending
review" message — the student cannot keep answering, cannot see the questions, and the
page cannot be tricked back into the exam view by reloading (the server re-checks
`attempt.status` on every request).

**Confirmed live** (Browser-pane pass, not the recorded one): dispatching a 3rd `blur`
event paused the attempt within about a second of the event firing, with no
intermediate state — auto-pause is immediate, not eventually-consistent.

---

## Part 6 — Faculty integrity review: both possible decisions

### 25. The pending-review queue

![Faculty pending integrity review queue](screenshots/25-faculty-pending-integrity-review-queue.png)

The chip reads **"3 strike(s) — paused."** This specific number was a bug in an
earlier version of this same day's work — it originally showed the raw event count
(5, including the 2 network events), which would have overstated the violation to a
grader glancing at the list. Fixed by exporting one shared `STRIKE_EVENT_TYPES`
definition that both this chip and the detail page below read from, so they can't drift
apart again.

### 26. The event trail — Alt+Tab and network events both clearly labeled

![Integrity review event trail](screenshots/26-integrity-review-event-trail.png)

All 5 events, in order: `Alt+Tab or window switch detected` (×3), `Network connection
lost`, `Network connection restored` — the two network rows carry a distinct **"Context
only — not a strike"** tag. This is the exact ask this pass exists to prove: the
review screen visibly distinguishes what caused the pause from what's just
context, and calls Alt+Tab by name rather than a generic "activity detected" phrase.

**Decision path A — Confirm Violation (recorded pass):**

### 27. Attempt terminated

![Integrity review resolved — terminated](screenshots/27-integrity-review-resolved-terminated.png)

### 28. The grading list still shows it — not silently dropped

![Grading list shows Terminated](screenshots/28-grading-list-shows-terminated.png)

A `TERMINATED` attempt disappears from the "pending review" queue (it's resolved) but
was, before this pass, also invisible from the main submissions list — a real gap: once
resolved, the record would vanish from every screen a faculty member would think to
check. Fixed by including `TERMINATED` in `listAttemptsForExam`'s status filter
alongside `SUBMITTED`/`GRADED`, with its own red "Terminated" badge.

### 29. The student sees why, not just a blank/zero score

![Student result — terminated banner](screenshots/29-student-result-terminated-banner.png)

*"This attempt was terminated following an integrity review — a faculty member
confirmed a violation after repeated warnings during the exam. Contact your instructor
if you believe this was in error."* — a plain-language explanation, not a bare "0/1."

**Decision path B — Reinstate (live Browser-pane pass, not recorded to file):**

Using a second exam (`Audience Live Demo`), the same 3-strike sequence was triggered
live and watched in real time. On the review screen, **Reinstate** was clicked instead
of Confirm Violation:

- Attempt status flipped from `INTERRUPTED` back to `IN_PROGRESS` immediately.
- The review page itself updated to read *"This attempt is no longer pending review
  (current status: IN_PROGRESS)"* — same code path as the terminated case, different
  outcome, both handled by the one `resolveIntegrityReview()` function.
- Signing back in as the student showed a **"Continue Exam"** button (not "Book" or
  "Start" — the existing booking/attempt was picked back up, not restarted).
- The student answered the question, clicked Submit, and received a normal graded
  result: **Score: 1 / 1** — proving a reinstated attempt is fully resumable and
  behaves identically to one that was never interrupted, all the way through to a
  clean finish.

This confirms both branches of the one human decision this whole feature exists to
protect: a real integrity concern can end a student's attempt for cause, and a false
alarm (or a legitimate distraction) can be dismissed with the student losing nothing —
neither their answers nor their remaining time.

## What this test does *not* cover

Said explicitly, matching this project's own documentation discipline:

- **Milestone 3** (structured legal-analysis grading, bar-subject tagging) — not built
  yet, so not tested here.
- **Hard time-gating** on the booked window — by explicit instruction, the window is
  currently informational only; Start Exam works immediately after booking regardless
  of the window's start time. Tracked in `docs/PITCH_ROADMAP.md` as a deliberate,
  noted gap for later hardening.
- **Real camera/ID/room verification** — the gate sequence is, and is meant to be,
  fully simulated. This test confirms the simulation behaves correctly, not that a real
  identity-verification integration would.
- **Automated regression coverage for this exact click-path** — this report is a
  manual/scripted verification pass, not a replacement for `npm test` (94/94 passing as
  of this commit) or `npm run test:e2e` (4/4 passing), which remain the actual
  regression safety net.

## Addendum — Milestone 5 (real proctor feature) verification, 2026-08-26

Unlike the walkthrough above, this pass was **not** driven interactively in a Browser
pane — this session's sandbox refused to launch a manual preview server against this
project (it lives outside the sandboxed working directory). Verification instead
combined three things, each real against the actual dev server and a real Postgres
database, not mocks:

1. **`npm test`** — 104/104, including new `proctoring.test.ts` (queue scoping by
   `CourseProctor` assignment, the approval gate refusing an unassigned proctor,
   `beginBookedAttempt` refusing without approval, submission-verification scoping and
   idempotency) and windowed-scheduling coverage added to `attempts.test.ts`.
2. **`npx playwright test`** — a real Chromium browser driving the real dev server,
   including a second browser context logging in as the seeded demo proctor
   (`proctor@cmlaw.demo`, assigned to LAW101) to approve both the start request and the
   finish request while the student's page was actually polling — nothing in this flow
   is auto-approved. Passed 2/2 consecutive runs after the fixes below landed.
3. **Direct Postgres inspection** (throwaway `tsx` scripts, deleted after use) to
   confirm `proctorRequestedAt`/`proctorApprovedAt`/`Submission.verifiedAt` were
   actually persisted, not just that the UI looked right — this is what caught both
   bugs below, since the first one produced no visible error at all.

**Two real bugs found and fixed during this pass** (not caught by `npm test`,
`npm run build`, or `npx eslint .`) — see `docs/ERROR_LOG.md` ERROR-007 and ERROR-008
for full root-cause detail:

- **ERROR-007**: the entry gate's proctor-approval poll loop silently froze forever,
  even after the proctor approved, because a `useEffect` cleanup meant to guard against
  polling after unmount was corrupted by React Strict Mode's dev-mode double-invoke —
  it flipped `cancelledRef.current` to `true` before the student ever clicked "Start
  Exam." Fixed by deleting the unmount guard; nothing else in this component needed one.
- **ERROR-008**: not an app bug — the E2E test's `page.click('button:has-text("Approve
  to finish")')` silently clicked the *first* matching button on the page instead of
  the one for this test run, because `Submission.verifiedAt` had never been set by any
  code before this milestone, so every historical graded attempt across this project's
  many prior live-verification sessions showed up in the proctor's queue too (10 items,
  not 1). Fixed by scoping the test's selectors to the specific row.

No screenshots were captured by this session for the pass described above (no
interactive Browser pane access) — the proof there is the passing automated suites plus
the direct DB verification described above, which is what actually caught the two real
bugs.

### Follow-up: real interactive confirmation by the user, same day

Separately from the above, the user ran their own full interactive click-through against
the same running dev server (`http://localhost:3010`), across four simultaneous browser
windows (Institution Admin, Faculty, Student, Proctor) — not the seeded demo data, but a
freshly created course (`SPLIT101 — TEST SPLIT`) with real faculty/proctor/student
accounts assigned via the admin and course-manage UI. Confirmed working, watched live:

- Faculty imported 50 real Philippine-Bar-style questions via CSV directly into a new
  exam and published it.
- Student booked the exam with a real scheduled time picked from the new
  `datetime-local` window picker (`Aug 26, 2026, 4:35 AM`), saw it echoed correctly on
  the receipt, and passed through the entry gate — including the soft fullscreen
  request actually engaging fullscreen, not just the mocked steps.
- The real wait-for-proctor gate held the student on "waiting for proctor" until the
  proctor, in a separate window, approved the request from `/proctor` — confirmed
  working, not simulated.
- After submitting (a 50-question exam — 20 answers landed in the pending-manual-grading
  queue, matching the mix of objective/essay question types imported), the student sat
  on the post-submission waiting screen until the proctor approved finishing from the
  same dashboard — confirmed working.

This is the first fully human-driven, real-account confirmation of Milestone 5's
complete flow (scheduling → real gate → real approval-to-start → real
approval-to-finish), independent of and consistent with the automated verification
above.

**One incidental note from this pass, not a Milestone 5 issue**: a hydration console
warning appeared, showing a `tracy-version` attribute present on the client but not the
server-rendered `<html>` tag. `src/app/layout.tsx` (the only file that could produce
this) hasn't been touched since an unrelated earlier commit, and `tracy` doesn't appear
anywhere in this codebase — consistent with Next.js's own explanation for this class of
warning ("a browser extension installed which messes with the HTML before React
loaded"), not an application bug. Also noted: the faculty grading list's pending-count
display is easy to miss on a large exam — logged in `docs/PITCH_ROADMAP.md`'s backlog
section, not addressed here.
